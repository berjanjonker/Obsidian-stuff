# Obsidian-stuff
## What is Obsidian?
Instead of me explaining what [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is and how to use it, I suggest you visit [the YouTube channel of Linking Your Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88&list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd) and watch a few of those free videos. Alternatively, [the help section of the Obsidian website](https://help.obsidian.md/Start+here) has detailed documentation that is worth a read.

Both resources walk you through the basics of how Obsidian works and what you can expect in the tool and its files. I strongly urge you to go watch those short videos, read the docs, and take notes. 
## Plugins
My goal is to keep things as simple as possible. This is the list of plugins I currently have installed:
- [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) - A template plugin for obsidian 
- [DataView](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) - Provides a query language for filtering, sorting, and extracting data from Markdown pages. 
- [Quickadd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) - QuickAdd is a powerful combination of four tools (called choices): templates, captures, macros, and multis.
- [Various Complements](https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/obsidian-various-complements-plugin) - This plugin enables you complete words like the auto-completion of IDE.

## My setup
I use the tools that I learned from [GRIP](https://gripbook.com/). For me daily notes works very well. During the day I dump all thoughts and stuff I want to remember in a single daily note. Once a week I go through the notes, add some context (so I can find it back at a later time) and archive it.

## Second brain
After reading the book of Tiago Forte about [Building a second brain](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/) it was clear to me that it is way to complex for my use case. I use my notes mainly for personal stuff. Work related projects have their own systems and methods. It is difficult to combine it in one note system. For work I use Obsidian to prepare meetings, make notes during meetings and use it for my personal development at work.
I ended up with a system for personal projects and a few special MOC(Maps of Content) notes for a few things.
- A new project (e.g. booking a trip) is a note in the root folder of my vault. I can easily add stuff and visit the note during the day. When it is finished I archive the projects(note) during my weekly review.
- For some things I use tags to retrieve things at a later point in time. I want to get rid of it and slowly converting stuff to MOC notes
